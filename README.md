# ManifoldsGPU

[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-dev-blue.svg)](https://juliamanifolds.github.io/ManifoldsGPU.jl/dev/)

General GPU/CUDA support for the JuliaManifolds ecosystem.

The package is in early stages of development, and the API is not yet stable.

Notes:

- `exp!` on `PowerManifold(Stiefel(32, 16), 2048)` is about 20x faster on CUDA.
- `PolarRetraction` is about 15x faster on CUDA. Batched SVD seems to work well.
- Detailed benchmarking scripts are in `benchmarks/`.
- QR decomposition doesn't seem to be particularly fast on GPU. Q matrix formation can't even be batched as of Feburary 2026.
